  Island sleeping.

  An island at rest can be put to sleep. Sleeping islands are skipped by the simulation step.
  Sleeping actors keep their positions and report zero velocity. An island wakes when its
  composition changes (e.g. an awake actor comes close to it). Islands can also be woken up
  explicitly via functions like WakeAll.

  After each solve, an island records a rest value (see StageRestValue). It goes to sleep once it
  has recorded SleepParams::minStepsBeforeSleep consecutive values of at least
  SleepParams::sleepThreshold.
