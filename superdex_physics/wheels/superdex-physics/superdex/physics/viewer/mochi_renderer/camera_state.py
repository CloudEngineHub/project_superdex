Camera bookkeeping for the MochiRenderer viewer.

The renderer server offers no camera readback, so the viewer owns the authoritative
pose and derives the look direction from it. This is a private copy of the Polyscope
``CameraState``; the two viewers share no state and Polyscope is on its way out.
